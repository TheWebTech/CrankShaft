# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Due to the way that HubSpot works and this framework works, the most recent version is all we can secure. 
We do not have a way to update a version already installed on someone's portal.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please DM Jon McLaren directly if you find a vulnerability. We will then work toward making an update to fix the security hole.
We do not have a bounty program for this, but if sponsorships end up funding us well, we will consider giving the person reporting a tip.

We take security reports seriously as this framework is used by a large number of HubSpot sites, and they would be at risk.
