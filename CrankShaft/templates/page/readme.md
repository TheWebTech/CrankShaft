# Page Folder
Use this for all Page Templates. 1 column, 2 column, holy grail, Contact Us, etc. Both Drag n Drop and Coded files should go here.

## bones.html
This file is meant to be the most bare bones good starting point to base any template off of. It only has enough to call the framework and your own styles, it doesn't do anything else.

## DND Bones.template.json
This is the drag n drop equivalent of the bones.html template.
Like bones.html it only has enough to call the framework and add your own styles, it doesn't do anything else out of the box.
