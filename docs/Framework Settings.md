# Framework Settings
The CrankShaft framework was designed to be modular in nature, you can choose to use all of it's features some, or heck you could disable everything and just use the folder structure and theme-variables. You can find ALL Crankshaft settings in `theme-variables.css`

## Macros
CrankShaft comes with a lot of helper macros, these macros help you to do repetitive or common tasks. You can disable them by setting `{% set macros = false %}` in theme-variables.css
<Page detailing all Macros to be added at a later time.>
