# Sponsor CrankShaft
CrankShaft is an open source hubspot framework project, built by the community for the community.

No one and yet everyone, is profiting off of CrankShaft. 
* Contributors donate their time and talents to the project to improve code, documentation, branding, project manage and build awareness of the project. Some contributors have sunk hundreds of hours in already, that means over a hundred hours at $0 per hour. This is volunteered time. This means if say that person recieved $100 and contributed over 100 hours, they made less than a dollar per hour. So no contributor to this project is greedy by any measure, and we are working on formalizing a standard way of issuing payments to contributors.
* Everyone is able to use this framework to build templates, custom modules, and themes off of or simply use it as a guideline for best practices when building on HubSpot. Templates, Custom Modules and Themes can be sold for profit. Website owners, can use the framework themselves to lessen their start-up costs, and enable them to sell and promote their products and services. As you can see everyone indirectly benefits or profits from this project.

## What ways can I sponsor?
There are 2 ways you or your company can sponsor the project.
* Financially - donate money to the project to be put toward advancing and maintaining the framework. We're still working out the details but for now, you can click the sponsor button on the GitHub Page for methods of financially supporting the project.
* Time - If you or your employees have development, design, writing, or marketing skills, you can commit to dedicating a number of hours per week or per month to the project. Doing so will help advance the project much faster than lone contributors. Your company will also have a bigger voice in the decisions for the project as more of your team would be actively involved.

## What do I get for sponsoring?
We're still working a lot of details but will acellerate this if you start a conversation with us about sponsoring. Some current ideas involve a banner being displayed on the github ReadMe and documentation site.

## I work for HubSpot what could we do to help?
There are a few great ways HubSpot can help the project.
* Create a new level of service for Open Source Projects, or atleast a special portal just for CrankShaft
    * We need a portal with the CMS addon, and ability to test email templates and modules which may be added to the framework down the road.
    * Developers currently create sandbox portals to test that their code is working as expected, but there's no central location for this, and no where to link to showing the code in-action, because you have to pay in order to put a domain name on a HubSpot portal.
    * On top of this the same portal can be used for the documentation website, setting up automated bug testing, and potentially if allowed sending emails to people interested in the project to keep engagement up.
* Have HubSpot developers be active in atleast watching over the framework to help ensure it follows best practices. There are things HubSpot developers know that community developers don't, and that can mean there may be a better way of doing something, but without HubSpot help, we won't know to do it.
* Donate a booth or space at a HubSpot run event like partner day, Inbound, Developer focused events.
* Invite top contributors to speak at events.
* Financially - HubSpot has the most to gain from a framework like this being developed. It improves the developer experience, making it easier for developers to get involved, encourages best practices that HubSpot can help shepherd. Makes HubSpot Support's job easier when it comes to templates and modules, as ones built on this framework will operate pretty consistently. On top of this your financial contributions would be feeding back to the developers who build on the HubSpot platform, further encouraging them to continue to do so.
